What is Encryption and Decryption:

Cryptography is the process of securing information that will be sent from one individual to another
only allowing the people intened to see the message to understand it. Cryptography works with designing
and solving codes to better protect and secure the trasfer of data.


Encryption is a process of converting plaintext(readable text) into another form of unintelligible writing that is unreadable. 

Decryption is the reverse process of encryption where unintelligible writing is converted back into readable text through the use of a key.



Page 1: How encryption works 

There are two main methods that are used to encrypt and decrypt data. 

Symmetric Cryptography:  In Symmetric Cryptography there is a single key used to both encrypt and 
decrypt the data being transfered. When the sender encrypts their data is is locked with a key 
to keep the data unreadable and out of the hands of the general public. The key is then transfered to the
message is intened for and they use this key to unlock the data and decrypt it making it readable again.
