                Ceaser Cipher
            </h3>
            <p>
                Ceaser Chipher is a simple type of encryption that uses substitution to shift the
letters in a sentence to something else. Before the encryption begins a shift value is implemented to
alter the sentence. This shift value works as the key. From there the sentence is broken up letter by letter and
shifted down the alphabet the amount of times as the shift value. A shift value of 2 would make the letter A turn into C 
and a value of 3 would make the letter C turn into F. If the shift passes the letter Z the process just begins
again from letter A.

                AES
            </h3>
            <p>
                AES is also known as Advanced Encryption Standard which uses a symmetric block cipher which takes a block of letters and
and encrypts the message block by block. Each block size is 128 bits which is the largest that have been created yet.
These blocks are encrypted using keys that are 128, 192 and 256 bits. Each block is given a differnet key and they are paired together. 
These encrypted blocks are then added togther and put into one longer ciphertext. When it reaches its destination the blocks are decrypted 
one at a time and the user is left with the original message.
