        <p>The debate over using renewable energies is something that has been getting a lot of focus, and with that a lot of confusion. What is a renewable power source? Why don't we have them now? Which one is the best? This webpage is here to clear up that confusion.</p>
        <p>A renewable power source is any source of energy that is constantly replenished, such as water from a river, or the sunlight from the sky. Harnessing these energies isnt a new technology, humans have been using them for hundreds of years. However, in the modern age people turned to cheaper and dirty energy sources, like coal and fossil fuels. As of June 2022, only 12% of the US electric grid uses renewable energy sources. </p>
