        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The exact history of Nuclear energy is somewhat controversial due to its political nature throughout the 20th century but its general timeline is as follows. Albert Einstein researches and develops his Theory of General Relativity, E=mc2. This then allows research into atomic fission During WWII, the Manhattan project,  American physicist Julius Robert Oppenheimer created the nuclear bomb. After this during The Cold War with Russia, the United States focused heavily on the development of energy production with nuclear sources. And as of now, the US has â…“ of the worlds Nuclear energy production, with 96 reactors producing a total of 90 gigawatts of energy.</p>

        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>Nuclear energy is considered to be a green energy source, but not renewable as it requires one key component, uranium 235. Nuclear power plants take this uranium and split it apart atom by atom. This releases massive amounts of energy as heat, which turns water into steam. The steam is used to turn the reactor's turbines to generate electricity. However, there is an unfortunate byproduct of this process. Nuclear power plants leave behind radioactive waste which require very careful procedures to keep safe. And this waste can stay dangerous for up to 1000 years. There is a second theoretical type of nuclear reactor which utilizes nuclear fusion. This process would be clean and renewable without the dangerous waste, but the technology for it is still years away.</p>
