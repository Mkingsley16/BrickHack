        <h2>History</h2>
        <p> Solar power itself was first developed in the late 1800â€™s, but humans have been harvesting the sun since the beginning of humanity. The first recorded active use of harnessing solar power was in 7th Century BC when humans used a sort of magnifying glass to light fires. The modern day use of the sun is solar panels. The solar panel was invented by a combination of many scientists, most notably Charles Fritz, who produced the first actual solar cells. SInce then solar panels have been massively improved upon and are an ever growing industry and power source in the United States, currently making up about 4% of the US electric grid.

        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>Solar panels absorb the sun's light into an array of photovoltaic cells. These cells are silicon wafers that transfer the photons into electricity. This electricity is then charged into wires that run through the wafers, and into batteries to be stored. Any excess energy produced can be sold back to the electric company to reduce a power bill. A house or building is wired into these batteries to use energy during the night when there isn't sunlight to power the solar panels.
