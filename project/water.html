        <h2>History</h2>
        <p> Water power was used since the earliest civilizations for irrigation or farming purposes, like the greek crushing flower with a water wheel. The first time it was used to generate electricity was a project to power a single lamp in 1878. The first hydroelectric plant opened in 1882 in Wisconsin, with hundreds more to open in the following decades. Currently, hydroelectric makes up 6.3% of the United States total electric production, and 31% of its renewable power.  Hydroelectric is the largest and oldest renewable energy source in the world, and will continue to be improved upon for years to come. </p>

    <article id ="how">
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>Hydropower utilizes a man-made diversion in a stream or river. This diverted water is directed through whatever systems the individual hydroelectric plant has. Generally, the water will flow through turbines, using its weight and the force of gravity to spin them, before then returning to the regular flow of the river. Unfortunately, hydroelectric plants interrupt the flow of wildlife throughout the stream unless precautions are taken.</p>
