        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The first archived use of wind energy was in 5000 BC to propel boats in the Nile river. In the middle ages, societies used windmills for agricultural purposes. In 1887 Charles F. Brush developed the first small electric wind turbine. And since then it has become a major part of the United States infrastructure, making up about 10% of all power generated on the grid. Large wind farms have been established in mountain ranges, and offshore. It is even available to be built for personal use to generate electricity for houses, business, farms, or any other building. </p>

        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>Wind energy is generated by large propeller-like blades being spun by the wind. The blades are connected to a rotor on a generator to make electricity. Wind turbines are usually very large, with many adjacent to each other in places with high wind speeds. There are two types of wind turbines, vertical and horizontal. Horizontal turbines have the three blades pointed in the </p>
